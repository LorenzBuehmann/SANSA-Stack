## Layers
The SANSA project is structured in the following five layers developed in their respective repositories:

* RDF: https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-RDF
* OWL: https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-OWL
* Query: https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Query
* Inference: https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Inference
* ML: https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-ML

## Release Cycle
A SANSA stack release is done every six months and consists of the latest stable versions of each layer at this point. This repository is used for organising those joint releases.
